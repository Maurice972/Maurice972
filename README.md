I have a passion for coding, which started as a complementary skill but has now become a full-time career and a personal interest that I thoroughly enjoy developing. 
My focus lies predominantly in the realm of web 3.0 and blockchain technology. I find great satisfaction in creating bridges between established practices and the emerging innovations of the digital landscape.

One of my strengths is the ability to connect dots by leveraging knowledge from various fields in which I have worked. This interdisciplinary approach allows me to bring unique perspectives and insights to my coding projects. By drawing upon diverse experiences, I can contribute a well-rounded and holistic approach to problem-solving.

I am excited to continue expanding my expertise in coding, exploring the possibilities of web 3.0 and blockchain, making meaningful contributions to this rapidly evolving field.
